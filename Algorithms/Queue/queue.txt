==> ds useful in algorithms where you need to process data in order
==>a queue contains the elements in the order they were added
==>elements are inserted at the end of the queue ad removed from the front
==>therefore follows first in first out FIFO rule
==>enqueue : add an item in the back 
==>dequeue: removes an item fron the front
==> peek: accesses the item at the front of the queue
==>linked list is standard implementation of queue
